# Technical Analysis
The basic technical concepts when dealing with stock investing. This are simple theories however, we shouldn't solely rely on these concepts to maximize profits as it is the case with patterns related to moving averages. Before going into this concepts, I will like to show how OHLC and Candlesticks are interpreted.
## OHLC(Open High Low Close) Charts:
The OHLC chart (for open, high, low and close) is a style of financial chart describing open, high, low and close values for a given x coordinate (most likely time). The tip of the lines represent the low and high values and the horizontal segments represent the open and close values. Sample points where the close value is higher (lower) then the open value are called increasing (decreasing).

The candle shows the Open price ,the High and Low price and the for each period of time.This differs slightly on wether the candle is Bullish(Up) or Bearish(Down).

## Candlestick Charts:
The candlestick chart is a style of financial chart describing open, high, low and close for a given x coordinate (most likely time). The boxes represent the spread between the open and close values and the lines represent the spread between the low and high values. Sample points where the close value is higher (lower) then the open value are called increasing (decreasing).

## Moving Average:
A moving average (MA) is a stock indicator that is commonly used in technical analysis. A moving average (MA) is a calculation that takes the arithmetic mean of a given set of prices over the specific number of days in the past. The reason for calculating the moving average of a stock is to help smooth out the price data by creating a constantly updated average price.
